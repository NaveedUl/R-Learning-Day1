# R Learning Day 1

This repository documents my first day learning R programming. It includes basic operations like:

- Printing messages
- Creating sequences
- Importing data from CSV/Excel
- Installing and loading packages
- Viewing and renaming columns
- Extracting specific rows and columns
- Using `dplyr::rename_with()` for column manipulation

## Packages used:
- `readxl`
- `dplyr`

## Notes:
- `file.choose()` pops up a file picker to select your input file.
- Use `colnames()` and `rownames()` to inspect and modify data frames.
- Use indexing like `[row, col]` to extract specific parts of the dataset.
